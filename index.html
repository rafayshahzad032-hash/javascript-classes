            JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in web development. It was originally created to make web pages more interactive and dynamic, allowing developers to do much more than what HTML and CSS alone could achieve. Today, JavaScript is an essential part of every modern website and plays a major role in front-end as well as back-end development.

When you visit a website, the text, buttons, and images you see are created with HTML, and their styling or layout is controlled by CSS. However, when you interact with the page — clicking a button, filling out a form, or seeing a pop-up message — that behavior is controlled by JavaScript. It brings life to web pages by allowing them to respond to user actions instantly.

JavaScript runs directly inside the web browser, meaning you don't need any special software to use it. Every major browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari can execute JavaScript code. You can easily add JavaScript inside an HTML file using the script tag.

In addition to handling alerts, form validation, and user interactions, JavaScript is also used for more advanced features such as animations, data fetching, and communicating with web servers. With the help of powerful frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue, developers can now create entire web applications using JavaScript.

In this assignment, we will explore the basics of JavaScript alerts, which are used to display messages or notifications to the user. The alert() function allows a web page to show a small dialog box with a message and an “OK” button. Its one of the simplest yet most useful ways to interact with the user and introduce you to how JavaScript works inside a browser.
